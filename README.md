This application will take a XML file with a list of messages structures and a binary file with data of all messages and will deserialize this data in several string formats.

The XML File will have the following data types:
- Messages
- Structures
- Arrays
- Enums
- Basic Data (integers, floats, doubles, chars, etc)

Tagless final pattern is used.
